## 📖 Overview

This assistant leverages real-time computer vision and NLP to guide users through changing a flat tire using an egocentric (chest-mounted) camera. Inspired by MECCANO project, this project focuses on practical, real-world assistance using a lightweight CV-NLP pipeline.

The assistant detects tools, tracks task progress, and provides interactive, step-by-step visual and voice instructions.

## 🔍 System Features

- **Real-Time Tool Detection**:
  - Identifies car jack, wheel wrench, and flat/new tires.
- **Action Recognition**:
  - Tracks task progression like loosening nuts, jacking the car, replacing the wheel, etc.
- **Voice Assistant**:
  - Responds to user queries such as "What’s next?" or "Am I doing it right?"
- **Edge-Friendly Pipeline**:
  - Designed for deployment on mobile or embedded systems.
